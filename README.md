# Dice Game 
A 2 player dice game made with Javascript DOM manipulation, addEventListener() and setTimeout(). Alternative JS file for 1 player mode

Designed with neumorphism CSS. Inspired by the aesthetics of one of my favourite synthesisers; the OP-1. 

*2 player game; If you roll a 1, its over! If you get over 21, you win! If you dont want to roll anymore, player 1 can hold and let player two take their turn. 

*Click new game - Player one rolls first.
*Player one rolls to victory or clicks hold.
*Now its player two's turn - click roll dice
*If player 2 rolls a 1 its over, if they score over 21 they win!
